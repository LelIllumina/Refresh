Society advanced and civilizations grew to make laws and rules. No made man rule is perfect, for complete foresight is impossible.
Even still, a failure of subjects to follow rules will lead to chaos, further entropic the more they stray off and disobey.

So then, what happens in a place where rules are not even mere suggestions but just words to be ignored? Falling further into disarray and displeasure, no system run on corruption and bribery could prosper but for the corrupt, and even then it will come crumbling down eventually.

Decades old Infrastructure born defected yet standing a grotesque pillar of society, the spawn of savagery can serve no one to supply health. Every 5 years a new bucket of paint, every other year new cracks unfilled. The bridges, the roads, the buildings, the homes, they all suffer and the suffering builds.

Resentment grows, resentment suppressed, the poor hold no power, yet it's still reduced. No. They do have power. The weak, the poor, the common man does have power. Every man, woman, and child can have their voice heard. Peaceful protest is your right, but it's not enough. Chants and Slogans can only do so much.

What we need is something drastic, like a civil war. Something that can rework the mess made by the false idols we so praise. We need people to fight against the detestable scum at the top, not be its underlings. To fight against those who swore to protect us but just leech our veins.

But the top isn't just the reason. The people themselves are too. Living in this virtue-less dystopia, they too fail to maintain order. Each person looks out for himself, no scrap of selflessness is left. Decades of this punished land has killed the soul the man here once had.

So how is a war to fix this self-serving den of heathens? It canâ€™t, not on its own, but it can serve as the catalyst. If the people fighting against the ones who suck them dry, fight it together. If they work together without cutting each other's back on every chance they get, they can change. If they focus on the joint enemy instead of their own skin, they can change. And if they start working for the good of everyone, they can prosper.

When things get this rough, you should step back and rethink instead of letting the broken train run its path. Restarting isn't easy, and it takes time, but when you're this deep in the pit it's better to go back, rather than climb on further the unclimbable hill.

The fetid piles of trash and the tire piercing rocks in the potholes can all be fixed in due time if the ones in charge don't eat the funds. Being surrounded by the filth that is people, you can get corrupted yourself, you start off throwing trash in inappropriate places and end up embezzling funds for shelter homes. All people grow towards immorality, and it's their jobs to go back on the right path. The utter failure of this by our people is the reason of this downfall. We are an apartheid state, the land stolen by Greed and Sloth.

But, it doesn't have to be that way. Fight for what is right and secure a better world for yourself and others.
