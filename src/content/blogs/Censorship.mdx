There are a few reasons content might be censored, usually it is to further am agenda, to propagandize the media you consume. There are a few types of censorship, which differ in terms of platform and method.

## “Protective” Censorship

News channels and social media will often blur or crop out visually alarming content, such as the likes of blood and gore, but more commonly swears and slurs. These serve no use besides subjugation. It's a deliberate cover-up on the raw emotion and situational tension in the given news.

For example, a man cursing out the government being censored just works to undermine his resolve. The bloody remains of a terrorist attack — after being censored — doesn't hold the same shock that should be conveyed on such a heinous disaster.

Censorship of information is a loss of quality that can easily be prevented. For those who would prefer the censorship for religious (swears and nudity) or personal (PTSD or hemophobia) should be able to opt in, Rather than everyone being supplied a dumb-ed down story that holds no value in the brains of the people. A news story that can't convey the same terror and anguish it should be able to.

And it should be displayed with that agony in full, as that's how the real situation will be conveyed to the viewer. Otherwise, it's just a propagandized piece of half-truths, designed to form your views and biases. Uncensored, Unfiltered news is you're right, you shouldn’t be lied to.

## Blatant Censorship

But besides the censorship of “extreme content”, there's also the subduing of regular people, mostly on online platforms. This dictates big social media companies using common methods like (Shadow) Banning, Post traction reduction, etc. to bury or hide content that they deem shouldn’t be shown.

The content usually denotes “political” conversation, such as the Israeli genocide on Palestine or American Right-Left leaning talks.
It is quite obvious why hiding posts with this content is harmful and a violation of being told the truth.

More so than the content, it is the way how these posts are hidden, which is interesting. I remember Instagram Reels about disclosing the lies by the Israeli and American governments or the Reels showing the atrocities of the IDF were being sneakily disabled from being reposted on Stories. Certain phrases in comments and posts could get you flagged and potentially banned (with or without your knowledge) and other methods reduced the spread of your message.

Hiding this benefits no one besides the oppressor. And as such it should be shared as much as possible, and not be censored at all.

## The Third Type

There's another form of censorship, a more… stupid form. Arguably more common than the last 2, it also has parts taken from those 2.  
Disallowing common swear words, and then — most notably on TikTok — only allowing euphemized words in its stead.

This is the origin of all the annoying words such as “Unalived”, “Grape”, “Corn”, etc. As well as the censorship via asterisking (“F\*ck”, “Sh\*t”, etc. There are a lot of very, very unnecessary and stupid ones, but none come to mind right now).

These serve no purpose besides bypassing automatic moderation, which essence itself provides no function.

## So should we just show everybody everything uncensored?

Not exactly. Content should be censored for people who would actually benefit from it, the aforementioned traumatized PTSD patients, people with conditions like Hemophobia, minors, etc. I don't mind Nudity, but I wouldn't want kids watching hardcore lesbian pegging. Censorship should be opt-in, an accessibility feature rather than a means to form beliefs, If you're uncomfortable with slurs and swears just turn on a filter that hides them. Don't turn the whole social media platform into a kindergarten.

Personally I don't like gore, but I rather opt in to censor that, rather than have it be hidden from everyone. This might seem contradictory to the point I made in the first section of this blog, but I rather spend my mental strength on people actually suffering rather than someone cutting off his testicles in a post on r/NSFL.
