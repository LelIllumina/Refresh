Before the internet, the average man probably did not know much outside of his own field of expertise. This is somewhat evident with how higher levels of superstition and baseless assumptions were popularly believed in the past, not that it is all that uncommon in the modern day. Today, though, many people learn about fields of study they wouldn't even have heard of, trivia about topics they were unaware existed, and other information they might not have a clue of the origin of.

In this vein of knowledge from the diverse fruit basket of life, I found quite a few interesting topics, mostly because they were presented as such. Geology wasn't a topic I'd be interested in if it wasn't for [Gniess Name](https://www.youtube.com/@gneissname), but what I learned a little more about, and what I related to more, was the few linguistics related channels.

Being technically bilingual, and furthermore, only having one of those languages be Latin script, comparing the grammar and rules of how a language works was reasonably interesting to me. I don't remember the names of the people who made these videos, but they would often talk about interesting and niche aspects of a language someone fluent in them might not even know. These little slices of knowledge weren't that accessible in the past, especially if you weren't white, but now you can scroll past them while trying to pass a fiberless turd. Not passing up on these, I slowly grew an interest, albeit small, in language.

There's a rich history behind my language; it's just that I personally don't know it, and with how some people speak it, I assume a lot of others don't know much about it either. It could be that when someone from a different area talks a little differently, it's just a dialect, but we don't have a system to account for that in place. All Urdu is Urdu, and it's the same Urdu regardless of region.

Rather than the inaccuracies of others, it's something else that was interesting to me, just the basic differences between our languages, in our grammar, and in our preconceptions attached to words. I sometimes try to translate a phrase to or from one language to the other, and I often realize how even if a word has the same meaning, it has many, many decades of history and usage attached that change its meaning in a given context. Unfortunately, I do not remember any off the top of my head, but such cases, quite obviously, do exist.

The main point, however, isn't that I managed to come to an obvious conclusion; it's that I ever got to the point that I could make a conclusion at all. The common man today can learn a great deal of so much compared to the man of the past, and this has in some ways helped us spread information, but propaganda and misinformation are rampant as well.
I don't know where I was going with this; I wanted to talk more about language, but I guess I got off-topic. It's quite early in the day, but for me, I haven't even slept.
