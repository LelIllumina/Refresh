I love her so much, I love all Female Main Characters so much!!

A few weeks ago I started playing Fate/Extra, I've finished that, and now I'm on Fate/⁠Extra CCC and both times I chose to play with Hakunon, aka female Hakuno Kishinami.

In every game where I have the option to choose a gender for my Character, I choose female, I just love women. I will go out of my way to play as a woman, I will play as Lumine, Rover (female), Gudako, Stelle or any other Female Main Character because I love them all so much, HOWEVER, hakunon is different, she's unique, no other female MC stands out as so different from the male MC as hakunon does, and not only that, no other MC is as GOOD as hakunon. This may be out of my love for Fate, but I just love hakunon, who's followed by none other than Gudako from FGO

I mean just look at her how is it even possible, and now she's even in FGO, I just have to wait my NA player ass for her to be added and hope I'm still playing the game when that happens, luckily she's a free SR :D

She makes me want to watch Fate/Extra Last Encore, which I have tried watching but ultimately failed because of how boring it is. As much as I love Fate/Extra I couldn't watch Last Encore, yet Hakunon makes me want to try again.

I forgot to add any special formatting in the text this time, and also to mention the fact I haven't posted anything for months. I also have a few Hakunon images left to use, so I'll just have them below.
