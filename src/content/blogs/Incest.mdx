They're quite resilient; I saw one today, an orange wasp of sorts, no matter how much I tried to drown it and beat it dead, it would limp itself dry and try to fly again. Eventually though, it decided to stay down for good.

I am not that fond of insects, especially the colorful or “soft” kind. The many legs of centipedes and caterpillars haunt me, even if they do look cool. This ambivalence bleeds through to things like character designs as well, as seen in the below image of me talking about Calne Ca.

Alongside her appearance, there is also the isopod on her head, which exacerbates that feeling.

Other than these many legged critters, flying bees and wasps with bright colors are not getting anywhere near me. I have fortunately never been stung by any big flying insect, but I have heard it is quite unpleasant, as such, I would like to avoid that sensation for as long as I can, myself manage.
I haven't had the (mis)pleasure of witnessing the bigger of the arthropods, such as crabs or scorpions, but I assume they wouldn't be much to my liking either.
The ones on the smaller sides, while not as creepy, make up for it in being annoying. Mosquitoes are the bane of my existence, they exist to annoy, steal, and spread disease, yet these spawns of purgatory still exist. People of the past treated their fellow human beings with less dignity than what we show to mosquitoes now. We must not let a single mosquito roam free, each should be nothing but fodder for their ecosystem. They should die not knowing the taste of blood or the sensation of skin on their feet. Their only purpose should be as food in the taut chain that is part of nature.

But not all is bad, there are a few insects that I am quite into. While not exactly the same category, spiders are arachnids, which is close enough in my book, and they are quite cool. House spiders do leave behind some webs, which could be annoying, but they also do eat some other, potentially harmful bugs. More importantly, they look cool. Unlike others, they don't have as creepy bodies, in some cases, they could look scary, but they're still better than others in my opinion.

However. For me, there is one that is better than all the rest, for some reason, I can't help but be happy when I see one. I have taken a liking to calling them “Goth Butterflies.” These are, of course, Moths.
There is just something about them that sets them apart, even though they fly around, which usually is quite frightening, is never the case with these. They don't make annoying buzzing noises and just have big cool wings. They don't bite or harm you in any way, and typically don't even get close to you, but well, they do eat up your clothes a little. In the end, though, they're just very pleasant fuzzy creatures that, compared to the others, are miles better. I love Moths.

P.S Im adding this later but I am quite fond of this image of leaf, her wings remind me of fly wings but I still think shes goated.
