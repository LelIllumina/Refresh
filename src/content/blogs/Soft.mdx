I read a light novel volume recently that had a character who was often defined as “Soft, but not kind”. It was meant to signify that her nature would make her feel bad if she saw something of that sorts, but wouldn't be kind enough to go help or change the situation. She wouldn't help the Sisters she was just soft. Not kind.  
She didn't like this trait of hers, she wished she didn’t have it, but that was who she was.

I hadn't, for some reason, read or seen a character described this way before. Reading on, I understood more of what it meant, and I realized how I sympathized with her.
I’m not kind. As much as I'd like to, I don't have the driving force to help others. I'd feel bad, both for them and for myself, but I wouldn't feel much of an urge to jump in and help.

A begger on the street selling something would instill… pity maybe? But not an urge to help.

A stray cat meowing for food would make me sad, but it'd be unlikely for me to go home and get food. Potentially if I already had some in my hand.

It's not like I don't want to help. I just don't end up doing it. Perhaps it's because of some deep-rooted indecisiveness that I have from being codependent with the only other resident in my home. I don't make choices until I have to, and then they're a hassle, so I just escape any situation I need to make a choice in.

The choice of whether to spare some change or not. The choice to whether work towards a goal that'd make other happy. The choice to step out of that flow of your life where stuff just happens, and you just go along. They all affect how kind you are. But I'm not kind, I'm just soft.

You could trace this further into a lack of willpower. Of how I can't handle a single urge without breaking. Of how I can't step out of that comfort zone of familiar situations, where I have the same lack of kind deeds leading to the same outcomes. Complacency with mediocrity is the sin of sloth. A spiral of punishment you can’t climb out of. You need to climb out to spawn your willpower, but you need your will to climb out.

It isn't hard to be kind if you've been kind before, but unfamiliar waters are hard to enter for everyone.
