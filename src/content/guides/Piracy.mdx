I often see people trying to pirate stuff off the Internet in the worst ways possible, and it vehemently destroys my mental health. Ass such I hold you all accountable for causing me mental trauma and I sentence you to rehabilitation, i.e., this guide to (objectively) better pirating. This is also how I pirate content because I’m the best. I’ll also add a tl;dr section to each part if you don’t want to read all the yapping.

Do note that this guide is opinionated and there are other options available, I’ll mostly just write about what I use and find the most convenient.

## Anime/Shows/Movie

Let’s start off with one of the most commonly pirated category, Digital video. While I don’t watch anime as much as I used to, and I haven’t really watched many shows and movies at all, I do want to experience the most convenient and high quality product there is. While I can’t do much about the hardware I have, getting the best video out there is not that hard, especially for anime.

<Aside variant="tip">
  Besides streaming from Stremio, if you prefer downloading and viewing your
  media, MPV is a great video player, I recommend

  [this](https://iamscum.wordpress.com/guides/videoplayback-guide/mpv-conf/).
</Aside>

### Stremio

[Stremio](https://www.Stremio.com/) is a Media server/Media Center/Content Aggregator/Whatever that unlike other similar products (Plex, Kodi, Jellyfin, etc.) has most of the processing done server-side, while this may seem like a con or disadvantage to a lot, it makes piracy way easier, especially on weaker hardware and slower internet. However, the real star is its add-on library, there are many useful plugins but with just 1 plugin you can get basically any show you want to instantly start streaming and at THE best quality you are likely to find. This is the [Torrentio](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure) add-on.

#### Torrentio

Most high quality videos aren’t on a central server with http streams, that poses quite a lot of issues related to bandwidth and reliability as well as longevity and redistribution/archiving. As such, a more common platform are torrents which have p2p. Torrentio aggregates torrent aggregating sites and provides magnet links in the Stremio client itself, making it pretty easy to load up Stremio, find a show you want to watch, click on any link Torrentio provided, and you have your stream running now, often times at faster download speeds than http piracy sites.

### Video Quality

When using Torrentio you’ll probably get many torrent links and knowing which one is the best is useful. At first glance, just picking the torrent with the biggest file size and most seeders would be the best choice as that usually indicates a higher bitrate, aka, better quality. But if you want more reassurance, at least for Anime, you can search for what you’re watching on these two sites:

- [Sneedex](https://sneedex.moe/)
- [Seadex/releases.moe](https://releases.moe/)
  FYI you can also make a better educated guess by looking at the torrent name, typically “BDRip” and “FLAC” are a good sign.

### Pro/Cons

| Pros                                                                                      | Cons                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Faster than regular HTTPS streams, especially if you're far from common server locations. | You might need to use a VPN depending on your country and ISP.                                   |
| Higher Quality Video and Audio than compressed content from piracy sites.                 | If an add-on’s server goes down, unless you self-host it, you have to wait for it to be back up. |
| Stremio syncs your library between devices.                                               | Server-side handling and requires an account.                                                    |

### Tracking

If you like to have your watched shows tracked, Stremio has built-in Trakt support, and you can get this [Anilist Add-on](https://github.com/Jenrykster/animeo) for Anilist support. If you want to stick with websites you have [MALSync](https://malsync.moe/) and for downloaded videos you can use [Taiga](https://taiga.moe/) (Windows only).

### TL;DR

Get [Stremio](https://www.Stremio.com/) and [Torrentio](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure) then look at either [Sneedex](https://sneedex.moe/) or [Seadex/releases.moe](https://releases.moe/). Get [Anilist Add-on](https://github.com/Jenrykster/animeo) for tracking.

<Aside variant="note">
  Stremio is cross-platform so you can use it on your Phone, TV, PC, or even
  just a browser, but iOS support is a bit broken. [This
  guide](https://blog.stremio.com/using-stremio-web-on-iphone-ipad/) might be
  more useful than the app.

## Manga

<Aside variant="important" title="Platform">
  I primarily use Android for reading manga. As such, most of the resources I’ll
  mention will be for Android. I might add resources for iOS and PC users later.
</Aside>

### Readers

On android, most of the options you have will be forks of [Mihon](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon) (Formerly Tachiyomi). I personally use [Kommiku](https://github.com/komikku-app/komikku) however you’re free to use any [fork](https://mihon.app/forks/) you like. I’ll just refer to all forks as “Mihon”.

Mihon is good for streaming manga or downloading it in-app, but higher resolution images won't look great thanks to the lack of better down scaling algorithms in Mihon.
If you plan to download Manga, likely in higher resolutions than with streamed sources, you’ll want to use [Perfect Viewer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rookiestudio.perfectviewer&hl=en) as it supports other algorithms.

Mihon should still be preferred if you’re not reading something that would need better rendering/scaling as it has a lot more features, namely streaming manga and checking for updates, but also tracking (MAL, Anilist, Kitsu, etc.), smoother page scrolling, and an overall more purpose built UI.  
Perfect Viewer on the other hand is primarily for viewing images and doesn’t have all those other features.

For iOS, most sources recommend [Paperback](https://paperback.moe/).

### Mihon (Streaming)

#### Extensions

By default, you won't be able to download and read anything when you install Mihon, you’ll need to get some extensions. For which you’ll need to add extension repos. The process is pretty straight forward, and you can just click the big button on these 2 sites:  
[Keiyoushi](https://keiyoushi.github.io/) and [Yuzuno](https://yuzono.github.io/). I haven't tested Yuzuno much, but only having that should work fine too.

After setting those up, you just need to navigate to your extensions tab and install a few. If you already use some manga sites, try installing the extensions for those if they exist, and besides those I recommend these:

- ComicK (Aggregator, lower quality bigger library)
- Mangadex (Library recently got nuked but should still have some in good quality)
- Weeb Central (Likely best quality, and fairly sized library)
- E-hentai (If you’re into that)

#### Categories

After you set up your extensions you need to add your manga itself, some forks support bulk imports using URLs and exported lists, but that depends on the forks. Typically, you’ll have to manually add your manga. You can do this by typing in the name in the search bar and then pressing global search.

When you do find your manga, open the entry and press “Add to library” you will have to choose what category to add the manga to. Here you’ll have to decide how to organize your library.  
There are multiple ways to set up your library, and it’ll depend on your personal preferences and habits.  
Unfortunately, I don't know of any fork that supports nested categories, but that's roughly how I'd describe how I organize my library. I’ll make a rough layout below, as nesting doesn't exist i just order them in a way they’re grouped together:

| Category           | Subcategories                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Reading Status** | Plan to read<br />Reading (Caught up with release)<br />Reading (Behind release)<br />On Hold<br />Completed (For stats) |
| **Genre**          | Slice of Life<br />Yuri<br />Shounen/Seinen<br />Meme Manga                                                              |
| **Franchise**      | Toaru<br />Fate                                                                                                          |
| **Format**         | Manga<br />Webtoon<br />Anthology<br />NSFW                                                                              |

After that, you can enjoy reading your manga and having auto updates and stuff.

#### Tracking

Setting up syncing with trackers is pretty straight forward, just follow the instructions on the settings page.

### Perfect Viewer (Downloaded)

Using Perfect Viewer itself is mostly self-explanatory, however getting the manga itself and making sure some settings are set correctly is important.

#### Downloading Manga

Like with anime, getting manga is primarily done on [Nyaa.si](https://Nyaa.si/) as it has the best quality and CBZ packed volumes. After downloading them, you don't need to extract the images, as both Mihon and PV support viewing the CBZ themselves.

#### Settings

These are mostly just aesthetic, but you should set “Image smoothing filter” in the 2nd tab to “Lancoz3” or your preference and turn on “Auto detect background color” in  
Last Tab → Preference → Display → Scroll down a bit.

### TL;DR

Get [Mihon](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon), add [Yuzuno](https://yuzono.github.io/) and then your favorite extensions for streaming.

Get [Perfect Viewer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rookiestudio.perfectviewer&hl=en) and download manga off [Nyaa.si](https://Nyaa.si).

## Afterword

I might update this guide in the future if I learn some new and useful stuff, but it’s unlikely. If you notice anything outdated or wrong, do tell me on my [discord](https://discord.com/channels/@me/1331059585896677378). I would like to point out that the methods I mentioned are – like a mentioned in the start – what seem the most “convenient” to me; Methods which strike a nice balance between ease of use and features. You can have a lot more “convenience” if you had a homelab (which I do not) and setup software like Jellyfin and Kavita on it. However, for a regular user with a regular PC/Phone, the things I’ve mentioned above should work great.

For more information on alternatives and useful information on a lot more topics I highly recommend [FMHY](https://fmhy.net/), [Wotaku](https://wotaku.wiki/), [Ripped](https://ripped.guide/) [thewiki](https://thewiki.moe/).
