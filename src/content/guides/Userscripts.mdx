Loads of sites have Userscripts written by some cool people that help out the user in various ways. Usually this is through some better behind the scene or by improving the site's UI/UX.
Userscripts CAN slow down your browser, especially if you have a lot of them, but it typically isn't too bad.

## Userscript Manager

Before getting some Userscripts you'll need a Script Manger, you have a few options: Tampermonkey, Greesemonkey, Firemonkey, etc. but I personally find Violentmonkey the best.
While Tampermonkey would give the most compatibility, I haven't really ever been affected by compatibility issues.
Honestly, Violentmonkey is the only manager I prolongably used and that's basically why I recommend it, It supports syncing with Google Drive and import/export is easy enough so it's fine for me and my +50 userscripts.
